<p style= "color:blue">I don't want to become an engineer when I grow up. I want to become a famous singer. I've always liked music and singing in choir.
 But I have been to two tech camps before. A manufacturing camp in Ansonia and this camp. The all girls camp at Holberton.
 Being a girl engineer means that there are mostly boys in the work place.
 I always thought that boys were better at math and girls english class.
 But i've met some other girl engineers who are multi- talented and even have double majors in the technical field.
